# LameGames
Lame Games is an organization created to bring programming and fun together. In this timed competition, <br>
two programmers use the Python programming language to create the best game possible between the two <br>
competitors. We hold friendly gaming competitions as well as providing full developed games that you can <br>
download through our website.

This repository contains all the files of this website; from the content to the login system. Our home page <br>
tells about us and the organization, and gives a link the user can download our Python application from. <b>(Our <br>
Application holds all developed games for users to play on their own computer)<b>. The leaderboards page shows <br>
the top scoring players in each game. After login, users are brought to their personal profile page where they can <br>
see where they rank globally, with their individual scores listed.

The creators Nathan Ley <b>(NathanLeysGit)</b> and Andrew Zwiefel <b>(Zellazoom)</b> hold all permissions to all <br>
the Lame Games' content.
