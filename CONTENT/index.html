      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Lame Games is an organization created by Nathan Ley and
       Andrew Zweifel to bring programming and fun together. 
       Lame Games offers fully developed games that can be played 
       by the public, as well as a friendly game developing 
       competition.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Part 1: The Competition</h2>
      <p>The competition is a timed event in which both Nathan and Andrew 
      must create the best game possible using the programming language,
      Python. The reason behind the name "Lame Games",comes from the competition
      where, under strict time limits, it is hard to create good games. The rules
      for the game are as follows:</p> 
      <br>

      <div class= "list">
        <ol>
          <li>The time limit in the competition is 30 minutes</li>
          <li>Competitors must start with a clean, empty file to begin</li>
          <li>The only language used must be Python</li>
          <li>There can be no copying and pasting from previous projects</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2>Part 2: Playable Games</h2>
      <p>On the other hand, Lame Game creators make games outside of the competition and
      the downloadable games have had much time and work put into. Players can create a 
      free account and <a href="#">download our provided games</a>. You can
      also <a href="#">check your stats and comparisons to other players</a>.</p>
