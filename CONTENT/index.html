      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Lame games is an organization
      created to bring programming and fun together. The creators, Nathan 
      Ley and Andrew Zweifel, both enjoy game development and competition
      so they combined both and created this organization. Lame Games offers fully developed 
      games that can be played, as well as a friendly game developing competition</p>
      <br>
      <p>Lame Games is creating new content, whether that be games, 
      videos, or tutorials. We are always accepting new members to be
      competitors in both our game development and game testing sections. Feel
      free to contact us if you are interested.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Part 1: The Competition</h2>
      <p>The competition is a timed event in which both Nathan and Andrew 
      must create the best game possible using the programming language,
      Python. The reason behind the name "Lame Games", is comes from the competition
      where, under strict time limits, it is hard to create good games.</p> 
      <br>

      <h2>Part 2: Playable Games</h2>
      <p>On the other hand, Lame Game creators make games outside of the competition and
      the downloadable games have had much time and work put into. Players can create a 
      free account and proceed to <a href="#" target="_blank">download our provided games</a>. On our website you can see
      how your scores compare to others.</p>
