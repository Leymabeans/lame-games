        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Lame Games website! Lame games is an organization
        created to bring programming and fun together. The creators, Nathan 
        Ley and Andrew Zweifel, both enjoy game development and competition
        so this series was brought to life.</p>
        
        <p>The competition is a timed event in which both Nathan and Andrew 
        must create the best game possible using the programming language,
        Python.The reason behind the name "Lame Games", is due to the fact
        that the games that are created in a rush don't usually end up well.
