          <p>Happy New Year to everyone! Itâ€™s going to be another banger kind of year. Lame Games has taken the extra time this holiday season to continue to push out more content, more games, and new ideas. The last few weeks here at Lame Games it has been very busy, and we are excited to share some updates with you! </p>
          <p>The switch has finally been made and the Lame Games website is no longer built with deprecated backend languages, and instead with more updated technologies. Profile searching is temporarily disabled until further notice. More information was added the the website regarding who we are and what we do so newcomers can understand our mission. We switched our hosting provider for more uptime, better build tools, and much faster loading speeds.</p>
          <p>We are excited to get Lame Games up and running with our application sometime in the near future! With the release of our application, 1.0 versions of our first two games will be released for everyone in the Lame Games community to enjoy. Names of the games as well as all the details will be released about a week before the launching of our application. No exact dates yet but you can expect to see some new game sneak peeks rolling out throughout the next month. We have been working hard on connecting the application to our server and database, so we will keep our fingers crossed that will get it all configured soon. </p>
          <p>We really are excited for the upcoming month! Nathan and Andrew are working hard to make sure that deadlines are met and that official game launches are epic. We hope you enjoyed reading up on our January News, if you have any questions, feel free to contact anyone here at Lame Games. </p>
