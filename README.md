# LameGames
<br><br>
<b>Overview</b><br>
Lame Games is an organization created to bring programming and fun together! In this timed competition, <br>
two programmers use the Python programming language to create the best game possible in a short period of time <br>
We hold friendly gaming competitions as well as providing full developed games on our application that you can<br>
download through our website. Lame Games was started back in the summer of 2018 and started building the software<br>
in the fall of '18. Lame Game's is expected to be up and running by the summer of 2019. <br><br>

<b>Content</b><br>
This repository contains all the files of this website and the application. Our site gives details about us and <br>
the organization, and gives a link the user can download our Python application from. Users can sign up for an account<br>
and check their stats on the games they've played on our application.<br><br>

<b>Development</b><br>
Nathan Ley <b>(NathanLeysGit)</b> built the front and backend of the website and Andrew Zwiefel <b>(Zellazoom)</b> created <br>
application. Both are respondsible for building the games you enjoy but are not respondsible if you mom yells at you for playing our video games too much. <br><br>

<b>Permissions</b><br>
Nathan Ley and Andrew Zwiefel hold all permissions to all of the Lame Games' content.
