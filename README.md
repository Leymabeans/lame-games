## UPDATE FALL 2020
As of 10/5/2020 the Lame Games organization and it's property are no longer being maintained. While working on the 5th version on the release of the website we have decided to no longer pursue the release of games to the public, and have abandoned the application. At this time, the website and it's previous versions will be taken down and Lame Games content will be removed as well.

<br></br>
## Overview
Lame Games is an organization created to bring programming and fun together! In this timed competition, two programmers use the Python programming language to create the best game possible in a short period of time. We hold friendly gaming competitions as well as providing full developed games on our application that you can download through our website. Lame Games was started back in the summer of 2018 and started building the software in the fall of '18. <br><br>

## Content
This repository contains all the files of this website and the application. Our site gives details about us and the organization, and gives a link the user can download our Python application from. Users can sign up for an account and check their stats on the games they've played on our application.<br><br>

## Development
Nathan Ley <b>(NathanLeysGit)</b> built the front and backend of the website and Andrew Zwiefel <b>(Zellazoom)</b> created
application. Both are responsible for building the games you enjoy but are not respondsible if you mom yells at you for playing our video games too much. <br><br>
