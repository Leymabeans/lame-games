# LameGames
Lame Games is an organization created to bring programming and fun together. In this timed competition, <br>
two programmers use the Python programming language to create the best game possible between the two <br>
competitors. The reason behind the name <i>Lame Games</i>, is that with a limited amount of time to develop <br>
the games, they are not the highest quality. <br>

Although a majority of games aren't developed well, there are some that have had substantial amounts of time <br>
and dedication put into them. These games can be played and downloaded through our website. <br>

The creators Nathan Ley <b>(NathanLeysGit)</b> and Andrew Zwiefel <b>(Zellazoom)</b> hold all permissions to all <br>
the Lame Games' content.
